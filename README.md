# CollatzConjecture
There exists an exciting conjecture that is extremely easy to solve and so interesting that if I wrote its statement here, even you would be tempted to grab a pen and paper to give it a try. And what if I say that despite this, no one has ever been able to prove it true. Well, thatâ€™s the beauty of the Collatz conjecture.

Collatz conjecture primarily concerns sequences starting with any positive integer. It says that if we start with any positive, say n, then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:

If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term, that is n/2.
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, that is 3n+1.

The series can be constructed by applying these two rules again and again. The conjecture says that no matter what the value of n is, the sequence will always reach 1, and keep looping between 4 and 1. Donâ€™t believe me? Letâ€™s take an example. Letâ€™s start with 10. So following the steps mentioned above, the sequence would be 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. This one was simple. Letâ€™s take another example, say n = 50. So the sequence would become 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. I know you are now tempted to check it for several other integers. So what are you waiting for? Just grab a pen and paper!

So despite the quintillion of positive examples on the conjectureâ€™s side, we need logical proof to demonstrate the authenticity of the Collatz conjecture. And this logical proof is something that we donâ€™t have yet!
